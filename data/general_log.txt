[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): We're supposed to be two bugs in a rug, two fish in the sea, which is so very hard for two racehorses to be.
[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): We always tie!"

[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): Tell you what, next race I'll let you win by a whole foot."
[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): So the next race came and Joe was ahead by a whole foot, but at the last second Moe jumped ahed and won the race.
[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): Back at the stable Joe said to Moe "What happened Moe?
[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): You were Supposed to let me win.
[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): We're supposed to be two bugs in a rug, two fish in the sea, which is so very hard for two racehorses to be.

[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): Back at the stable Joe said to Moe "Moe what happened?

[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): I promise next race I'll let you win by a whole half lap."
[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): So the next race came came and Joe was ahead by a whole half lap when, at the last second, Moe jumped ahead and won the race.
[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): On the way back to the stable Joe's owner said to him "Joe, I've been losing a lot of money lately.
[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): If you don't win your next race I'm going to have to sell you to the glue factory."
[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): Back at the stable Joe said to Moe "Moe if I don't win the next race I'm going to be sold to the glue factory!
[02/27/21] 07:21 AM  (Fam Bot): We're supposed to be two bugs in a rug, two fish in the sea, which is so very hard for two racehorses to be!
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): We always tie!"
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): Moe replied "Joe I'm so sorry I had to win that last race.
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): I swear on my mother's grave that I won't even leave the starting gate next race."
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): So the next race came and Joe was about to pass the finish when, at the last second, Moe bolts out of the starting gate and wins.
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): Back at the stable Joe said to Moe "Moe!
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): Now I'm going to go to the glue factory what happened?"
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): to which Moe replied "I'm sorry Joe at the last second I got this feeling and couldn't lose that race!"
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): The old Dog in the corner saw this argument and said to Moe & Joe "Y'know you two are supposed to be two bugs in a rug, two fish in the sea, which is so very hard for two racehorses to be.
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): You always tie!"
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): "You to are supposed to be best friends and thats something special that very few have these days.
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): You got to keep that."
[02/27/21] 07:22 AM  (Fam Bot): Moe & Joe then looked at each other and simultaneously said "Hey look everybody, a talking dog!"
